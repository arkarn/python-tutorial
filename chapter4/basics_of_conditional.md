# Conditional Statements: Quick Overview

## Overview
Conditional statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on specific conditions. In Python, the primary conditional statements are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

## Syntax
```python
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is true
elif another_condition:
    # code to execute if another_condition is true
else:
    # code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
```

## Example
```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a child.")
```
